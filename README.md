# Assignment-3: ICP + Non-linear least squares optimization

### Simple Non-Linear least squares for Gaussian function
 * Using Gradient Descent
 * Using Gauss-Newton
 * Using Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm 
 * Comparsion among all 3 algorithms
### ICP: Iterative Closest Point Algorithm
Let X be your point cloud observed from the initial position. Your robot moved and observed P1 as your current point cloud. Same with P2 under a different transformation. Now you wish to apply ICP to recover transformation between (X & P1) and (X & P2). Use root mean squared
error (rmse) as the error metric.
